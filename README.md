## 👁️ Entities

### 🔹 **1. Static**

> The first and most mysterious entity. It sees all.

* **Appearance**: Jet-black humanoid, no face, no eyes — a void in the shape of a person.
* **Spawns**: After nightfall, randomly 100+ blocks away
* **Behavior**:

  * Appears in the player list (`TAB`)
  * Has a 40% chance to reply to your chat messages with cryptic or disturbing messages
  * Says vague prophecies like:

    > *"He stares beyond render."*
    > *"Something crawls where light can't touch."*
* **Lore**: Static is the first breach, a watcher from the noise beyond. It knows what’s coming. It was never meant to enter your world — and now it cannot leave.

### 🔹 **2. Observer** *(Coming Soon)*

> A corrupted villager twisted by knowledge it should not possess.

* **Spawns**: After Day 1, 20% chance every 10 mins, only one at a time
* **Behavior**:

  * Follows player silently, kills mobs while unseen
  * Vanishes when stared at for too long
  * Breaks glass to enter your home
  * Rarely knocks on windows and watches you
* **Counter**: Stare directly at it to make it run away
* **Weapon**: Can wield axes and chase player if ignored too long

### 🔹 **3. Fracture** *(Coming Soon)*

> A static creature of height and horror — a glitch given form.

* **Looks Like**: Tall, wireframe humanoid with glitched 2D textures, its body shifting constantly like broken code
* **Spawns**: After Day 1, increasing chance every 10 mins
* **Behavior**:

  * If approached or stared at, plays loud distorted shrieks and **kicks you from the world**
  * Makes a deep, mechanical static noise when near
  * Watching it too long forces a fake crash screen (or black screen with code)
  * Cannot be damaged or stopped
  * Sleeping disables it temporarily
* **Lore**:

  > Fracture was never meant to exist. It is what happens when something ancient becomes self-aware inside corrupted files. It doesn't walk — it *distorts*. It sees through blocks, through code, through memory. No one survives its stare.
  > *It is the glitch in the shadows. The wound in reality.*
* **First appearance message (in chat)**:

  > `Something has cracked the world... Fracture is watching.`

### 🔹 **4. Spectral** *(Coming Soon)*

> The glitch behind the code — it wears flesh as disguise.

* **Looks Like**: 5-block-tall entity with circuit textures and static face
* **Abilities**:

  * Transforms into mobs (dark versions of sheep, pig, cow, villager, creeper)
  * Reveals true form when close, screams, and attacks
  * Leaves trail of static sound
* **Spawn Chance**: 10% Day 0–1 → 30% by Night 4+
* **Lore**:

  > Spectral is the cause. It created the rest. It is a parasite hidden in the data of your world — rewriting, replicating, becoming. Where it passes, mobs change. Reality flickers.

### 🔹 **5. Herobrine** *(Coming Soon)*

> A corrupted version of legend — angrier, smarter, more persistent.

* **Behavior**:

  * Spawns signs with disturbing messages
  * Places strange structures (camps, blood, burnt trees)
  * Gets more powerful each night
  * Nametag appears flickering by Night 2
* **Interaction**:

  * Destroys structures if tampered with
  * Sometimes appears with Static or Alexbrine and stares at you before vanishing

### 🔹 **6. Alexbrine** *(Coming Soon)*

> A calmer, quieter, more mysterious shadow of Herobrine.

* **Behavior**:

  * Places subtle but eerie signs
  * Stares from inside player homes holding torches
  * Giggles or flickers before vanishing
* **Does Not Kill**, but can jumpscare

### 🔹 **7. Mimicer: `User_1`** *(Coming Soon)*

> Wears your face and walks your path.

* **Spawns**: Night 5
* **Looks Like**: Exact copy of player — skin, items, everything
* **Behavior**:

  * Cannot be killed
  * Stares, mimics, then walks away
  * Night 6+: If stared in the eyes, **chases and kills you**

### 🔹 **8. Redacted** *(Coming Soon)*

> Unknown. No files found.

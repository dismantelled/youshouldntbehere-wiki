## 👁️ Entities

### 🔹 **1. Static**  
> The first and most mysterious entity. It sees all.

- **Appearance**: Jet-black humanoid, no face, no eyes — a void in the shape of a person.  
- **Spawns**: After nightfall, randomly 100+ blocks away  
- **Behavior**:
  - Appears in the player list (`TAB`)
  - Has a 40% chance to reply to your chat messages with cryptic or disturbing messages
  - Says vague prophecies like:
    > *"He stares beyond render."*  
    > *"Something crawls where light can't touch."*
- **Lore**: Static is the observer, the announcer. It knows what’s coming.

### 🔹 **2. Observer** *(Coming Soon)*  
> A corrupted villager twisted by knowledge it should not possess.

- **Spawns**: After Day 1, 20% chance every 10 mins, only one at a time  
- **Behavior**:
  - Follows player silently, kills mobs while unseen
  - Vanishes when stared at for too long
  - Breaks glass to enter your home
  - Rarely knocks on windows and watches you
- **Counter**: Stare directly at it to make it run away  
- **Weapon**: Can wield axes and chase player if ignored too long

### 🔹 **3. Halt** *(Coming Soon)*  
> A static creature of height and horror.

- **Looks Like**: Tall, wireframe humanoid with glitched textures (2D corrupted style)  
- **Spawns**: After Day 1, increasing chance every 10 mins  
- **Behavior**:
  - If approached or stared at, plays loud sound and **kicks you out of the world**
  - Makes static noise when near
  - Watching it too long forces a game crash
- **Note**: Sleeping disables it temporarily

### 🔹 **4. Spectral** *(Coming Soon)*  
> The glitch behind the code — it wears flesh as disguise.

- **Looks Like**: 5-block-tall entity with circuit textures and static face  
- **Abilities**:
  - Transforms into mobs (dark versions of sheep, pig, cow, villager, creeper)
  - Reveals true form when close, screams, and attacks
  - Leaves trail of static sound
- **Spawn Chance**: 10% Day 0–1 → 30% by Night 4+

> A corrupted version of legend — angrier, smarter, more persistent.

- **Behavior**:
  - Spawns signs with disturbing messages
  - Places strange structures (camps, blood, burnt trees)
  - Gets more powerful each night
  - Nametag appears flickering by Night 2
- **Interaction**:
  - Destroys structures if tampered with
  - Sometimes appears with Static or Alexbrine and stares at you before vanishing

### 🔹 **6. Alexbrine** *(Coming Soon)*  
> A calmer, quieter, more mysterious shadow of Herobrine.

- **Behavior**:
  - Places subtle but eerie signs
  - Stares from inside player homes holding torches
  - Giggles or flickers before vanishing
- **Does Not Kill**, but can jumpscare

### 🔹 **7. Mimicer: `User_1`** *(Coming Soon)*  
> Wears your face and walks your path.

- **Spawns**: Night 5  
- **Looks Like**: Exact copy of player — skin, items, everything  
- **Behavior**:
  - Cannot be killed
  - Stares, mimics, then walks away
  - Night 6+: If stared in the eyes, **chases and kills you**
